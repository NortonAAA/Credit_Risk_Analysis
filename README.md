# Credit_Risk_Analysis
Module 17 Challenge

## Overview of Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to review the level of accuracy, precision, and recall scores of six different machine learning models. 

## Results
There were 2 groups of models leverage Resammpling models and Ensemble Models. Each method has it's Accuracy along with it precision and recall scores in generated in the Machine Learning Environment as example below for Random Oversampling

#### Resampling Models
1. Naive Random Oversampling
2. Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE)
3. Cluster Centroid Undersampling
4. Combination (Over/Under Sampling) - Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique with Edited Nearest Neighbor (SMOTE-ENN or SMOTEENN)

#### Ensemble Models
1. Balanced Random Forest Classifier
2. Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier
